## <a name="what-is-prime-launch"></a>What is Prime Launch?

Prime Launch is a platform to host decentralized and fair token launches on Ethereum ‚Äî designed for teams who need simplicity, speed and performance. It‚Äôs powered by Balancer V.2 and curated by PrimeDAO.

- Project teams and DAOs can use Prime Launch to seamlessly attract resources and distribute tokens to a wide audience of contributors.
- Users looking to acquire tokens can get access to a list of newly launching high-quality Web3 projects curated by PrimeDAO.

## <a name="idos-made-better"></a>Prime Launch: IDOs made better

With the advancement of decentralized finance, an increasing number of crypto projects have shifted from listing tokens on centralized exchanges to listing on decentralized exchanges. With this transition, new mechanisms for market-making and token offerings have emerged. These mechanisms are generally called **Initial Decentralized Offerings (IDOs)**. IDOs have removed many frictions from the industry as projects no longer need to wait (or pay) for centralized exchanges to list their assets, and as a consequence, this has allowed a more diverse group of Web3 projects to emerge.

While IDOs remove some friction to token launches, they also create new type of challenges, namely:

- They require time and money to research available IDO tools and in most cases to develop custom interfaces and contracts;
- They normally have large initial capital requirements depending on the protocol
- They suffer from exploits like [*front-running*](https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/research/decrypt/arbitrage-and-frontrunning-in-defi) and [*sandwich attacks*](https://hackernoon.com/no-sandwich-please-popular-defi-attack-strategy-analysis-jk1734rf).
- They suffer from poor curation or total lack of curation on the part of decentralized exchange interfaces, making it difficult for users to find reputable new projects.

Prime Launch provides DAOs with ready-to-use launch infrastructure: low initial capital requirements, smooth UX, and a relevant network of users.

The first question most people have is, of course, how is Prime Launch different from everything else out there? Here‚Äôs a table to give you a quick summary:

In short, other open platforms are generally difficult to use or don't give you off-the-shelf control & ownership of your launches. Prime Launch provides the best tradeoff between design simplicity and decentralized ownership.

## <a name="types-of-launch"></a>Types of Launch

As of today, Prime Launch allows you to create two types of launch:

-¬†**Seed Launch**, a simple way to host a decentralized token offering to raise early investments at a fixed price.

-¬†**Liquid Launch** allowing a project to conduct a fair market-based discovery of the token price and to boosts its already existing liquidity.

<br>

Please see below for a quick breakdown of the benefits and differences between the two:

### <a name="over-seed-launch"></a>Seed Launch
üå± **Seed Launch** allows early-stage projects to host a launch without needing to pre-allocate any resources and with the ability to select which contributors are able to participate.

**Seed Launch Benefits:**

- *Decentralized:* Prime Launch uses decentralized infrastructure and is run by PrimeDAO core contributors
- *Simplified:* pre-determined maximum amount raised & quantity of tokens sold
- *Allowlist:* projects can optionally specify which addresses are allowed to invest in the seed launch
- *Vesting:* projects can set vesting and cliffs periods for contributors

### <a name="over-seedlbp-launch"></a>Liquid Launch (LBP)
üåä **Liquid Launch (LBP)** leverages the [Balancer V2](https://docs.balancer.fi/) infrastructure. It uses a novel token distribution mechanism, the Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP), to disincentivize large contributors from buying all tokens in one go and to punish bots, leading to more fair and accessible distributions.

**Liquid Launch (LBP) Benefits:**

- *Decentralized*: Prime Launch uses decentralized infrastructure and is run by PrimeDAO core contributors
- *Capital-efficient:* LBPs help distribute more tokens at efficient price points with less initial capital
- *Fair*: LBPs' constant downward price pressure disincentivizes front-running (a market manipulation practice) and large buys from whales, giving better opportunities to your intended early contributors
- *Multi-asset:* smart order routing means that users can trade any token in exchange for the project token at the price of higher slippage (using Balancer on the back end)
- *Multi-use:* it allows you to configure your launch to segue into another use-case (e.g to serve as a 50/50 AMM after the initial sale)

Another benefit of Liquid Launches is Balancer's rewards protocol: users of the protocol receive BAL tokens to make up for any transaction costs. This means that up to 90% of your transaction costs when participating in Liquid Launches will be reimbursed in the form of BAL tokens.

## <a name="prime-launch-background"></a>Prime Launch Background 
(TODO)

Prime Launch was created by¬†Person1 /and Person2 (alt: group, PrimeDAO) in 20xx following an initial strategic workshop to create a new, modern DAO bootstrap platform to serve new DAOs.

So, we do things a little differently to most others:

Why we have build it, and how it connects with PrimeDAO value and mission.
