### Why should I use Prime Launch for my token sale?

Prime Launch offers two launch types:

1. Seed Launches, perfect for controlled, initial fundraising.
2. Liquid Launches, ideal for larger public offerings optimized for fair price points and reduced front-running (TODO: add link to glossary).

Prime Launch is also owned and operated by a DAO, Prime DAO, which comes with a number of benefits (decentralization, stakeholder ownership, transparency). When you use Prime Launch, the Prime Network is buying into your launch and makes a number of other services and products available to you, such as shared liquidity pooling, R&D, developing, and communications support (see the [Prime Forum](https://forum.prime.xyz/)).

### How is Prime Launch governed and operated? Who owns Prime Launch?

Prime Launch is owned and operated by Prime DAO, which funded Prime Launch's development and appoints the signers on the Prime Launch multi-sig. The multi-sig is responsible for approving new launches to appear in the Prime Launch interface.

### Can I request support services from Prime DAO without launching on Prime Launch?

Yes! You can inquire about them via the [Prime Launch Support Form](https://primedao.typeform.com/PrimeLaunchSup), in the [Prime Forum](https://forum.prime.xyz/) or by reaching out in the [PrimeDAO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG).

### **What is the process of an LBP launch on Prime Launch?**

1. The project owner fills in the launch parameters in the registration wizard (Project name, Project Description, cliff period, vesting period, Project Token Address, LBP start time and LBP end time, Start Weights, End Weights, etc) and submits the launch application.
2. The prime launch evaluation team will review your project and reach out to you within 10 days to understand your specific case and answer the questions you might have.
3. DAO-appointed Prime Launch multi-sig will take up to 5 days to approve or deny your launch submission.
4. If your launch is approved, it will be visible on the Prime Launch interface.
5. Once your launch is approved, the project admin has to fund the LBP with the specified project tokens and the funding tokens. This step requires your approval of three transactions
6. At the start time of the LBP, when the weights are scheduled to start changing, the project admin has to enable swapping by clicking on “unpause swapping” on the admin dashboard.

### **What to do at the end of the LBP?**

At the start time of the LBP, the project admin has to disable swapping by clicking on “pause swapping” on the admin dashboard. After that, the admin can remove liquidity through the admin dashboard.

### **When can the liquidity be removed?**

The project admin can remove liquidity after the LBP has ended.

### **How to pause an LBP? How does it work?**

The project admin can pause the LBP through the admin dashboard by clicking on “pause swapping”. This action will disable purchasing from the Prime Launch interface but it will not stop the weights changing process. If the LBP is paused after the LBP has started, the project admin can unpause the LBP anytime on the admin dashboard.
