<!-- # LexDAO -->

LexDAO is a club of web3 lawyers building the next generation of contracts. LexDAO is a club, not a law firm and not even an incorporated entity. LexDAO is an unincorporated nonprofit association under *Wyo. Stat. Title 17, Ch. 22* of the laws of the State of Wyoming. For explicit statement, no individual DAO member is an agent of other DAO members or for LexDAO, LLC.

Lawyers within LexDAO, independent of the DAO itself, will often support projects with legal aid after a consultation.
