## CORE CONCEPTS

### Why should I use Prime Launch for my token sale?

Prime Launch offers two launch types:

- **Seed Launches**, perfect for controlled, initial fundraising.
- **Liquid Launches**, ideal for larger public offerings optimized for fair price points and reduced front-running.

Prime Launch is also owned and operated by a DAO, Prime DAO, which comes with a number of benefits (decentralization, stakeholder ownership, transparency). When you use Prime Launch, the Prime Network is buying into your launch and makes a number of other services and products available to you, such as shared liquidity pooling, R&D, developing, and communications support (see the [Prime Forum](https://forum.prime.xyz/)).

### How is Prime Launch governed and operated? Who owns Prime Launch?

Prime Launch is owned and operated by Prime DAO, which funded Prime Launch's development and appoints the signers on the Prime Launch multi-sig. The multi-sig is responsible for approving new launches to appear in the Prime Launch interface.

### How can I get in touch with the core Prime Launch team?

You can always reach out to us in the [PrimeDAO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG).

### **On which chains does Prime Launch operate?**

Currently, Prime Launch operates on Mainnet and Arbitrum. We are expanding to other chains in the near future (Celo and Gnosis Chain). Please check our [PrimeDAO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG) and the [PrimeDAO Announcement Telegram Channel](https://t.me/primedaonews) for these updates.

### **How does Prime Launch pricing work?**

### **What are other services Prime provides?**

To complement Prime Launch, PrimeDAO also provides a wide range of support products and services to help projects start up successfully. Indeed, with every launch, PrimeDAO Ecosystem Marketing & PR squad will help you craft the narrative around your launch, co-promote it and design assets for our and your channels, and most importantly we will bring our partner DAOs into the mix to co-market (i.e. BalancerDAO, GitcoinDAO, OlympusDAO, etc, depending on relevance to your product).

Related to token launch, we offer services from our partners which includes:

**Longtail Financial**

**LexDAO**

**YapDAO**

**ByteRocket**

**Bankless Consulting**

Please visit this section (TODO add link: here) to understand better how each of these partner can help you boost your launch success!

It’s also important to remember that PrimeDAO offers a few other products to support your DAO to evolve:

- **Prime Rating**: quantifying quality and risk of open finance protocols by providing a benchmark score.
- **Prime Deals**: facilitate DAO-to-DAO deal-making process including token swaps and co-liquidity provisions
- **Prime Pools:** DAO-governed liquidity pools that bridge liquidity between allied ecosystems and create index pools.
- **Proposal Inverter:** a funding primitive that enables multiple groups or individuals to collaborate on common proposals.

### Can I request support services from Prime DAO without launching on Prime Launch?

Yes! You can inquire about during your application process and get more informed about them via the [Prime Launch Support Form](https://primedao.typeform.com/PrimeLaunchSup), or by reaching out in the [PrimeDAO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG).

### What’s the main difference between Seed Launch and Liquid Launch (LBP)?

In short, **Seed Launch** is a simple way to host a decentralized token offering to raise early investments at a fixed price, and allow you to define a list of addresses that are allow to participate. Whereas, **Liquid Launch** allows a project to conduct a fair market-based discovery of the token price and to boosts its already existing liquidity.

### What are Vesting Period & Cliff Period?

A vesting period is the amount of time, beginning after the cliff, during which a contributor's purchased tokens unlock linearly.

A cliff period is the amount of time during which contributors who have received tokens cannot transfer them.

### **What is the geo-block feature?**

The geo-block feature prevents a standard list of geographic locations from contributing to your launch. The restricted regions include Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Guyana, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, United States, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Venezuela, Yemen, and Crimea.

### Which states can a launch be in?

A launch can be:

- **UNINITIALIZED**: the launch has been accepted for launch and need to be funded by the admin.
- **PLANNED**: the launch has been funded is scheduled to go live at a certain date & time
- **LIVE**: the launch is on-going and it’s accepting contributions
- **PAUSED**: the launch is on-going but it’s temporarily paused
- **CLOSED** (only for SEED): the Seed launch is over or has been closed by the admin

### **What can a project admin do?**

The project admin can create a launch, determine the launch parameters, start the launch, pause the launch, fund the launch, and remove liquidity.

### **Who has access to the admin dashboard?**

Only the project admin has access to the admin dashboard. More specifically, the project admin has to be connected to the wallet address that was connected while submitting the launch application through the Prime Launch registration wizard.

### What’s the Maximum Project Token Supply?

The **Maximum Project Token Supply** is the maximum amount of project tokens to exist over the project's lifetime. If there is no maximum, you can provide a reasonable estimate.

### What’s the Project Token Distribution per Stakeholder Group?

The **Project Token Distribution per Stakeholder Group** is a table that defines the planned or already happened distribution of project tokens existing between different stakeholders. When setting up launch, projects who issue tokens in multiple rounds should clearly demarcate the amount of tokens distributed in each round by defining a Stakeholder Group for each of these rounds.

## SEED FAQ

### **What is an allowlist?**

An *allowlist* is the list of addresses that are allowed to contribute to a seed launch.

At Prime we’re excited that the world is adopting new words to transcend the ones that come from the world’s colonial heritage, that’s why we don’t use words like *blacklist* or *whitelist.*

### What is the Project Token Exchange Ratio?

Your **Project Token Exchange Ratio** is the proportion of value that you want to set with the funding token. For example, a 1.5 Project Token Exchange Ratio will provide 1 of your project’s token in exchange of 1.5 Funding Token to contributors of your Seed Launch.

### What is the Funding Tokens Target?

Your **Funding Tokens Target** is the minimum amount of funding tokens that you want to raise in your Seed Launch to deem it successful. If the Funding Target is not reached by the end of the seed duration, the contributors have the option to retrieve their contribution.

### What is the Funding Tokens Maximum?

The **Funding Tokens Maximum** is the maximum amount of funding tokens that you want to raise in the seed. Once the Funding Maximum is reached, the seed will automatically end and the vesting period, if there is one, will begin.

## LIQUID LAUNCH (LBP) FAQ

### What is a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) in Prime Launch?

A Liquid Launch is a public token offering that works by attempting to bootstrap the liquidity of a new token. Liquid Launches use Balancer v2's Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) to facilitate fair and efficient conditions for distributing tokens. The mechanism has been used dozens of times with [promising results.](https://medium.com/perpetual-protocol/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-lbp-60a61b368c82)

Essentially, LBPs are liquidity pools that change weights over time throughout the sale period. As the weights change, they create selling pressure on the project token, leading to the price of a project token dropping if there is no buying pressure. So the pool is normally set to start with a relative high weight of project tokens (e.g. 95%) in respect of a relative small weight of funding tokens (e.g. 5% DAI). During the Liquid Launch, often 2 to 3 days, the pool weights are continuously rebalanced toward the funding token, which leads the project token's price to slowly decline. Contributors can participate at their preferred price point, while bots and arbitrageurs do not benefit from front-running (as buying early generally leads to overpaying).

The result is a fair and accessible token launch shown to effectively discover the market price of an asset and raise funds for the project team, without requiring prohibitive initial capital or enabling problematic front-running.

In practice, this means that contributors should avoid participating too early in Liquid Launches because the valuation will be high, and no price discovery has taken place. The closer to the end of the Liquid Launch, the project token has experienced more price discovery, creating a more stable conditions for new contributors.

For a complete breakdown of how Liquid Launches work on the back end, please read Balancer's [primer](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/a-primer-on-fair-token-launches-and-liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-11bab5ff33a2) or visit the [Balancer V2 Documentation](https://docs.balancer.fi/).

### What are pool weights in an LBP? How do I setup start and end weights?

LBP pool weights are expressed in percentage and are calculated based on the market value. Since the project token you are offering has no defined market value at the time of launching an LBP (most likely), this value is defined in proportion to the relative exposure with the funding token.

For example, with an LBP weight ratio of 2:98 (Funding Token:Project Token), if your upfront capital of funding token is 50K USDC, and your starting price is 10 USDC, the amount of tokens you can sell is [(50K / 0.02) / 10] = approx. 250K tokens. In contrast, if your upfront capital is 1M USDC, you’d be able to sell around 5M worth of tokens.

The price of your token will be discovered though market dynamics during the LBP, but when you define the start weights you are intrisically giving **your project’s tokens an initial value by collateralizing them.**

The general idea is to start with the pool weights heavily pitched towards your Project Token, and then gradually shift the weights towards the Funding (Collateral) asset by the end of the launch. In this way the majority of your Project Tokens end up being exchanged for the Funding (Collateral) Token you have chosen. By adjusting these parameters the sale can be set to keep the price more or less steady, or declining to a desired minimum (i.e. minimum price target).

Another important thing to keep in mind is that the lower you set the weights of the Funding (Collateral) asset in your LBP, the less upfront capital you would need to seed your launch. In a Prime LBP, the most pitched ratio in favor of your Project Token that you can set is 2:98, meaning that the pool composition will be 2% your Funding (Collateral) asset, and 98% the Project Token.

However, keep in mind that since the value of your Project Token is proportional to the value of the Funding (Collateral) Token you provide for the launch, the amount of funds you can raise in the launch is limited by the total value of the Funding (Collateral) Tokens you provide to the LBP.

To learn more about how LBP and weights work please refer to this primer on the [Balancer Documentation](https://docs.balancer.fi/v/v1/guides/smart-pool-templates-gui/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool).

Decide on critical parameters, such as LBP duration, starting and ending weights, and estimate the demand (i.e., expected sale rate), is extremely important. Balancer also provides a [LBP simulator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t6VsMJF8lh4xuH_rfPNdT5DM3nY4orF9KFOj2HdMmuY/edit?usp=sharing) that allow you to define these parameters according to your expectations. You can also reach out to us and we will help you out to understand and define the most strategic parameters for your launch.

### How does LBPs' constant downward price pressure works?

In essence, the constant downward price pressure in an LBP is algorithmically-defined in the smart contract that automatically adjust swap rates as time passes.

As we said, LBPs are liquidity pools that change weights over time throughout the sale period: from higher weights for project tokens to ideally meet the weight of the funding token. The weight determine the swap rate, so at the beginning the price will be relative high and contributors will be disincentivize to buy at that price, we call this *selling pressure* on the token. This is counterbalanced by the *buying pressure* generated by the automatic weight decrease encoded in the LBP smart contract: essentially, as time passes the project token weights decrease, increasing the desire for contributors to buy the project tokens.

### In short, w**hat is the process of an LBP launch on Prime Launch?**

1. The project owner fills in the launch parameters in the registration wizard (Project name, Project Description, cliff period, vesting period, Project Token Address, LBP start time and LBP end time, Start Weights, End Weights, etc) and submits the launch application.
2. The prime launch evaluation team will review your project and reach out to you within 10 days to understand your specific case and answer the questions you might have.
3. DAO-appointed Prime Launch multi-sig will take up to 5 days to approve or deny your launch submission.
4. If your launch is approved, it will be visible on the Prime Launch interface.
5. Once your launch is approved, the project admin has to fund the LBP with the specified project tokens and the funding tokens. This step requires your approval of three transactions.
6. At the start time of the LBP, when the weights are scheduled to start changing, the project admin has to enable swapping by clicking on “unpause swapping” on the admin dashboard.
    
    Please refer to the LBP Wizard Walkthrough to get a more detailed overview (TODO add anchor).
    

### **What to do at the end of the LBP?**

At the start time of the LBP, the project admin has to disable swapping by clicking on “pause swapping” on the admin dashboard. After that, the admin can remove liquidity and any unused project tokens through the admin dashboard.

### **When can the liquidity be removed?**

The project admin can remove liquidity after the LBP has ended.

### **How to pause an LBP? Why I would want to pause it?**

The project admin can pause the LBP through the admin dashboard by clicking on ‘Pause Swapping’. This action will disable purchasing from the Prime Launch interface but it will not stop the weights changing process, which are a function of time passing. If the LBP is paused after the LBP has started, the project admin can unpause the LBP on the admin dashboard at anytime.

### What multi-asset means in Liquid Launch?

It means that users can trade any token in exchange for the project token at the price of higher slippage.
