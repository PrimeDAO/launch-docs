### Experience Beats Everything

Working closely with various independent security researchers, byterocket constantly explores new ways to ensure your Smart Contract's safety.

## The Audit Process

### Manual Review & Analysis

Multiple auditors go through the smart contract code - line by line - looking for bugs and potential vulnerabilities. They profoundly analyse the implemented logic and its implementation.

### Tools & Testnets

Having concluded a manual analysis, they then leverage state-of-the-art software to analyse and test your code even further, including methods like fuzz-testing. Additionally, they deploy your smart contracts to a testnet to see how it behaves in reality.

### Final Discussion

Having finished the review and analysis independently, our auditors now internally discuss their findings and go through the code once more. The discussion includes possible attack vectors and challenging the protocol in theory and practice.
