## Brand Positioning Workshop

What is your story, and how do you communicate it in one sentence? In a crowded industry, we are all fighting to get media attention on our projects for raises, new product launches, and to contribute to the DAO and decentralization narrative. What separates a successful project from an unsuccessful one often comes down to how well we communicate the industry problem we are solving.

*A Brand Positioning workshop and Brand Guide ensures your project has the tools needed to deliver your message to a wide audience.*

**Deliverables**: Brand Positioning Workshop:

- A full media audit of owned/earned channels
- Competitor analysis
- Review of vision and missions statements, one-liner and project descriptions
- Development of a media positioning strategy
- Development of key media targets and owned channel strategy

**What you receive in return:**

- 1.5 hour workshop with the YAP DAO team
- A 5 page Brand Positioning guide, that is then condensed after the initial sessions
- A finalized 1-2 page Brand Guide with core messaging, to be used in all internal/external communications
- A follow up .5 hour sync to ensure all parties are pleased with Brand Guide, and review on how the Brand Guide was helpful to the DAOs
