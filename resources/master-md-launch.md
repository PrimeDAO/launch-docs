# GETTING STARTED

## <a name="what-is-prime-launch"></a>What is Prime Launch?

Prime Launch is a platform to host decentralized and fair token launches on Ethereum ‚Äî designed for teams who need simplicity, speed and performance. It‚Äôs powered by Balancer V.2 and curated by PrimeDAO.

- Project teams and DAOs can use Prime Launch to seamlessly attract resources and distribute tokens to a wide audience of contributors.
- Users looking to acquire tokens can get access to a list of newly launching high-quality Web3 projects curated by PrimeDAO.

## <a name="idos-made-better"></a>Prime Launch: IDOs made better

With the advancement of decentralized finance, an increasing number of crypto projects have shifted from listing tokens on centralized exchanges to listing on decentralized exchanges. With this transition, new mechanisms for market-making and token offerings have emerged. These mechanisms are generally called **Initial Decentralized Offerings (IDOs)**. IDOs have removed many frictions from the industry as projects no longer need to wait (or pay) for centralized exchanges to list their assets, and as a consequence, this has allowed a more diverse group of Web3 projects to emerge.

While IDOs remove some friction to token launches, they also create new type of challenges, namely:

- They require time and money to research available IDO tools and in most cases to develop custom interfaces and contracts;
- They normally have large initial capital requirements depending on the protocol
- They suffer from exploits like [*front-running*](https://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/research/decrypt/arbitrage-and-frontrunning-in-defi) and [*sandwich attacks*](https://hackernoon.com/no-sandwich-please-popular-defi-attack-strategy-analysis-jk1734rf).
- They suffer from poor curation or total lack of curation on the part of decentralized exchange interfaces, making it difficult for users to find reputable new projects.

Prime Launch provides DAOs with ready-to-use launch infrastructure: low initial capital requirements, smooth UX, and a relevant network of users.

In short, other open platforms are generally difficult to use or don't give you off-the-shelf control & ownership of your launches. Prime Launch provides the best tradeoff between design simplicity and decentralized ownership.

## <a name="types-of-launch"></a>Types of Launch

As of today, Prime Launch allows you to create two types of launch:

-¬†**Seed Launch**, a simple way to host a decentralized token offering to raise early investments at a fixed price.

-¬†**Liquid Launch** allowing a project to conduct a fair market-based discovery of the token price and to boosts its already existing liquidity.

<br>

Please see below for a quick breakdown of the benefits and differences between the two:

### <a name="over-seed-launch"></a>Seed Launch
üå± **Seed Launch** allows early-stage projects to host a launch without needing to pre-allocate any resources and with the ability to select which contributors are able to participate.

**Seed Launch Benefits:**

- *Decentralized:* Prime Launch uses decentralized infrastructure and is run by PrimeDAO core contributors
- *Simplified:* pre-determined maximum amount raised & quantity of tokens sold
- *Allowlist:* projects can optionally specify which addresses are allowed to invest in the seed launch
- *Vesting:* projects can set vesting and cliffs periods for contributors

### <a name="over-seedlbp-launch"></a>Liquid Launch (LBP)
üåä **Liquid Launch (LBP)** leverages the [Balancer V2](https://docs.balancer.fi/) infrastructure. It uses a novel token distribution mechanism, the Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP), to disincentivize large contributors from buying all tokens in one go and to punish bots, leading to more fair and accessible distributions.

**Liquid Launch (LBP) Benefits:**

- *Decentralized*: Prime Launch uses decentralized infrastructure and is run by PrimeDAO core contributors
- *Capital-efficient:* LBPs help distribute more tokens at efficient price points with less initial capital
- *Fair*: LBPs' constant downward price pressure disincentivizes front-running (a market manipulation practice) and large buys from whales, giving better opportunities to your intended early contributors
- *Multi-asset:* smart order routing means that users can trade any token in exchange for the project token at the price of higher slippage (using Balancer on the back end)
- *Multi-use:* it allows you to configure your launch to segue into another use-case (e.g to serve as a 50/50 AMM after the initial sale)

Another benefit of Liquid Launches is Balancer's rewards protocol: users of the protocol receive BAL tokens to make up for any transaction costs. This means that up to 90% of your transaction costs when participating in Liquid Launches will be reimbursed in the form of BAL tokens.

## <a name="prime-launch-background"></a>Prime Launch Background 
(TODO)

Prime Launch was created by¬†Person1 /and Person2 (alt: group, PrimeDAO) in 20xx following an initial strategic workshop to create a new, modern DAO bootstrap platform to serve new DAOs.

So, we do things a little differently to most others:

Why we have build it, and how it connects with PrimeDAO value and mission.

# FAQs

(TODO: move appropriately)

## <a name="general-faq"></a>General FAQs

### Why should I use Prime Launch for my token sale?

Prime Launch offers two launch types:

1. Seed Launches, perfect for controlled, initial fundraising.
2. Liquid Launches, ideal for larger public offerings optimized for fair price points and reduced front-running (TODO: add link to glossary).

Prime Launch is also owned and operated by a DAO, Prime DAO, which comes with a number of benefits (decentralization, stakeholder ownership, transparency). When you use Prime Launch, the Prime Network is buying into your launch and makes a number of other services and products available to you, such as shared liquidity pooling, R&D, developing, and communications support (see the [Prime Forum](https://forum.prime.xyz/)).

### How is Prime Launch governed and operated? Who owns Prime Launch?

Prime Launch is owned and operated by Prime DAO, which funded Prime Launch's development and appoints the signers on the Prime Launch multi-sig. The multi-sig is responsible for approving new launches to appear in the Prime Launch interface.

### Can I request support services from Prime DAO without launching on Prime Launch?

Yes! You can inquire about them via the [Prime Launch Support Form](https://primedao.typeform.com/PrimeLaunchSup), in the [Prime Forum](https://forum.prime.xyz/) or by reaching out in the [PrimeDAO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG).

### How can I get in touch with the core Prime Launch team?

Reach out in the [PrimeDAO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG).

### **Who has access to the admin dashboard?**

Only the project admin has access to the admin dashboard. More specifically, the project admin has to be connected to the wallet address that was connected while submitting the launch application through the Prime Launch registration wizard.

### **What can a project admin do?**

The project admin can create a launch, determine the launch parameters, start the launch, pause the launch, fund the launch, and remove liquidity.

### **On which chains does Prime Launch operate?**

Currently, Prime Launch operates on Mainnet and Arbitrum. We are expanding to other chains in the near future. Please check our Discord channel for these updates.

### **What are other services Prime provides?**

(TODO: add links)

With every launch, PrimeDAO Ecosystem Marketing & PR squad will help you craft the narrative around your launch, co-promote it and design assets for our and your channels, and most importantly we will bring our partner DAOs into the mix to co-market (i.e. BalancerDAO, GitcoinDAO, OlympusDAO, etc, depending on relevance to your product).

Related to token launch, we offer services from our partners which includes:

**Longtail Financial**

**LexDAO**

**YapDAO**

**ByteRocket**

Please visit this section (here) to understand better how each of these partner can help you boost your launch success!
****

It‚Äôs also important to remember that PrimeDAO offers a few other products to support your DAO to evolve:

- **Prime Rating**: quantifying quality and risk of open finance protocols
- **Prime Deals**: facilitate DAO-to-DAO deal-making process including token swaps and co-liquidity provisions
- **Prime Pools:** DAO-governed liquidity pools that bridge liquidity between allied ecosystems and create index pools.
- **Proposal Inverter: (TODO: add)**

### **How to seek technical support from Prime?**

Please reach out to us via the [PrimeDAO Discord](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG) or fill in our [Prime Launch Support Form](https://primedao.typeform.com/PrimeLaunchSup)

### **What is a cliff period?**

A cliff period is the amount of time during which contributors who have received tokens cannot transfer them.

### **What is a vesting period?**

A vesting period is the amount of time, beginning after the cliff, during which a contributor's purchased tokens unlock linearly.

An allowlist is the list of addresses that are allowed to contribute to a seed launch.

### **What is the geo-block feature?**

The geo-block feature prevents a standard list of geographic locations from contributing to your launch. The restricted regions include Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Guyana, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, United States, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Venezuela, Yemen, and Crimea.

### How to participate in a Launch

(DEPRECATED)

## <a name="lbp-related-faqs"></a>LBP RELATED FAQs

### **What is the process of an LBP launch on Prime Launch?**

1. The project owner fills in the launch parameters in the registration wizard (Project name, Project Description, cliff period, vesting period, Project Token Address, LBP start time and LBP end time, Start Weights, End Weights, etc) and submits the launch application.
2. The prime launch evaluation team will review your project and reach out to you within 10 days to understand your specific case and answer the questions you might have.
3. DAO-appointed Prime Launch multi-sig will take up to 5 days to approve or deny your launch submission.
4. If your launch is approved, it will be visible on the Prime Launch interface.
5. Once your launch is approved, the project admin has to fund the LBP with the specified project tokens and the funding tokens. This step requires your approval of three transactions
6. At the start time of the LBP, when the weights are scheduled to start changing, the project admin has to enable swapping by clicking on ‚Äúunpause swapping‚Äù on the admin dashboard.

### **What to do at the end of the LBP?**

At the start time of the LBP, the project admin has to disable swapping by clicking on ‚Äúpause swapping‚Äù on the admin dashboard. After that, the admin can remove liquidity through the admin dashboard.

### **When can the liquidity be removed?**

The project admin can remove liquidity after the LBP has ended.

### **How to pause an LBP? How does it work?**

The project admin can pause the LBP through the admin dashboard by clicking on ‚Äúpause swapping‚Äù. This action will disable purchasing from the Prime Launch interface but it will not stop the weights changing process. If the LBP is paused after the LBP has started, the project admin can unpause the LBP anytime on the admin dashboard.

# SEED LAUNCH

‚Äã‚ÄãA Seed Launch is a token offering by an early-stage project to a small group of contributors, in order to raise initial resources for the venture.

Seeds use a fixed swap function: contributors can swap the funding token for the seed token at a fixed, pre-determined price. Seeds specify a funding target: if the funding target is not met, contributors can reclaim their tokens.

Project teams may also specify (with an allowlist) which addresses will be allowed to contribute to their Seed. Seed Launches may also include a token vesting schedule for contributors, including both a cliff (lock) and a linear vesting period. This means the project team can specify:

- **Cliff**: an amount of time during which contributors who have received tokens cannot transfer them.
- **Vest**: an amount of time, beginning after the cliff, during which a contributor's purchased tokens unlock linearly.

To host a Seed Round on Prime Launch, see <a href="">Apply to host a Launch</a> or head straight to the <a href="/register">application page</a>. To contribute to a launch, see <a href="/documentation/contribute-to-a-launch">Contribute to a Launch</a> or view all upcoming launches <a href="/launches">here</a>.

# SEED LAUNCH WALKTHROUGH

## <a name="basic-setup-to-host"></a>Setup your wallet and start the wizard

1. Visit [https://launch.prime.xyz/register](https://launch.prime.xyz/register) (for Mainnet) [https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz](https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz/)/register (for Arbitrum).
2. Click on ‚ÄòConnect to a Wallet‚Äô and accept the [Prime Launch Disclaimer](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service) (TODO: harmonize, here is called disclaimer, at the end of the seed is called Terms of Service). Make sure you are connected to the intended network.
    - You need to have a compatible wallet set up. Prime Launch connects to most Ethereum wallets, including Metamask and all wallets compatible with WalletConnect. If you don't have an Ethereum wallet yet, set up a [Metamask account](https://metamask.io/) or use a WalletConnect-enabled mobile wallet like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/).
    - You will need to fund your wallet with some ETH for paying the transaction costs needed to setup the launch (~$25 worth of ETH is safe). Most wallets will give you instructions on how to acquire those tokens and ETH.

    - Define your **Project Token Exchange Ratio** with the funding token. For example, a 1.5 Project Token Exchange Ratio will provide 1 of your project‚Äôs token in exchange of 1.5 Funding Token.
    - Define your **Funding Tokens Target** which specifies the minimum amount raised to consider the Seed Launch successful. If the Funding Target is not reached by the end of the seed duration, the contributors have the option to retrieve their contribution.
    - Define **Funding Tokens Maximum** which specifies the maximum amount to be raised in the Seed Launch. Once the Funding Maximum is reached, the seed will automatically end and the vesting period, if there is one, will begin.
    - Define the **Vesting Schedule** for the people that will participate as contributors in the Seed Launch. Input the duration in days in which the Project token is vested. Vesting is released linearly by default. The cliff is the period in which no tokens can be withdrawn or used ‚Äî they are locked until this date. (TODO: check if we have a more updated copy of this in Deals). Please consider to set a starting date that is not sooner than 5 days from now as this will allow PrimeDAO to multisig approve this launch (TODO: check if it makes sense to specify).
    - Define the **Seed Schedule** which is the period in which your Seed Launch will be open for contributions. The schedule can end before the End Date in the case your Seed Launch reaches the Funding Tokens Maximum.
6. (optional) If you want to allow specific address to contribute to your Seed Launch, add a URL to an Allowlist in .csv format containing the list of addresses that are allowed to purchase Project tokens. The file must be formatted as plain text and each address must be separated from its neighbor addresses by one or more commas, spaces, tabs or carriage returns. Example using only commas: (TODO: make sure new nomenclature is used across Launch and Deals)
    
    ```
    0x1234,0x5678,0xabcd,0x7890
    ```
    
7. (optional) If you want your contributors to sign a legal disclaimer, add a URL to a file containing the text of the disclaimer. If supplied, all contributors must accept the disclaimer in order to access the launch. The disclaimer must be formatted as plain text or Markdown. [(More info about Markdown)](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
8. (optional) Toggle the Geoblock in case you want to prevents the following list of geographic locations from contributing to your launch:

    Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Guyana, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, United States, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Venezuela, Yemen, the Crimea.
9. Define the Administrator wallet address. The Seed Administrator has the ability to pause and close the seed, alter the allowlist and withdraw funding tokens.
You can define the address you‚Äôre connected to the website with by clicking ‚ÄòI will be the administrator‚Äô. Alternatively you can choose another address to be administrator by simply input that address in the Seed Administrator text field.

# LIQUID LAUNCH

A Liquid Launch is a public token offering that works by attempting to bootstrap the liquidity of a new token. Liquid Launches use Balancer V2's Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) to facilitate fair and efficient environments for distributing tokens. The mechanism has been utilized dozens of times with [promising results](https://medium.com/perpetual-protocol/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-liquidity-bootstrapping-pool-lbp-60a61b368c82).

In the back end, a Liquid Launch is an adjustable Balancer V2 pool designed for initial distribution and price discovery of a new asset. The pool will generally start with a high weight of project tokens (e.g. 95%) and a small weight of funding tokens (e.g. 5% DAI). During the Liquid Launch, often 2 to 3 days, the pool weights are continuously rebalanced toward the funding token, which leads the project token's price to slowly decline. Contributors can participate at their preferred price point, while bots and arbitrageurs do not benefit from front-running (as buying early generally leads to overpaying).

The result is a fair and accessible token launch shown to effectively discover the market price of an asset and raise funds for the project team, without requiring prohibitive initial capital or enabling problematic front-running.

For a complete breakdown of how Liquid Launches work on the back end, please read Balancer's [primer](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/a-primer-on-fair-token-launches-and-liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-11bab5ff33a2) or visit the [Balancer V2 Documentation](https://docs.balancer.fi/).

To host a Liquid Launch, see <a href="/documentation/host-a-launch">Apply to host a Launch</a> or head straight to the <a href="/register">application page</a>. To contribute to a launch, see <a href="/documentation/contribute-to-a-launch">Contribute to a Launch</a> or view all upcoming launches <a href="/launches">here</a>.

Next up, you will need to setup the **Liquid Launch Details** following these guidelines (you can get in touch with your Launch Account Manager? to understand how to better setup these details according to your strategy) (TODO: add updated contact form link / clarify nomenclature to Launch Account Manager):
    - Select from the dropdown menu the **Funding Token** you want to raise, which is the token that your contributors will have to use to fund your LBP Launch in exchange your project‚Äôs tokens.
6. At the moment you can choose between Prime (D2D), Olympus (OHM), Governance OHM (gOHM), Dai Stablecoin (DAI), USD Coin (UDSC), Wrapped Ether (WETH).
(TODO: correct tooltip in Project Token Exchange Ratio, from *The Ethereum address of the token used to purchase project tokens. Simply put: the token you are raising funds in (e.g. DAI) to ‚ÄòThe Token used to purchase your project tokens‚Äô*
    - (TODO: change ui copy from ***Number of tokens that you will provide to the LBP*** to ***Amount of Tokens that you provide to the LBP*)** Define the total amount of Project Tokens that you will provide to the LBP and the total amount of Funding (Collateral) Tokens that will be supplied to set up your Liquid Launch.
    - Define the Start & End Date and Time as well as the Start & End Weights of your Liquid Launch.
7. LBPs leverage a dynamic weighting that shifts throughout the pool‚Äôs lifespan, finding a fair market value by starting at a relatively higher price and lowering the price over time by adjusting the weight ratios if there are no purchases.

    The general idea is to start with the pool weights heavily pitched towards your Project Token, and then gradually shift the weights towards the Funding (Collateral) asset by the end of the launch. In this way the majority of your Project Tokens end up being exchanged for the Funding (Collateral) Token you have chosen. By adjusting these parameters the sale can be set to keep the price more or less steady, or declining to a desired minimum (i.e. minimum price target).

    Another important thing to keep in mind is that the lower you set the weights of the Funding (Collateral) asset in your LBP, the less upfront capital you would need to seed your launch. In a Prime Liquid Launch, the most pitched ratio in favor of your Project Token that you can set is 2:98, meaning that the pool composition will be 2% your Funding (Collateral) asset, and 98% the Project Token.

    However, keep in mind that since the value of your Project Token is proportional to the value of the Funding (Collateral) Token you provide for the launch, the amount of funds you can raise in the launch is limited by the total value of the Funding (Collateral) Tokens you provide to the LBP.

    For example, with an LBP weight ratio of 2:98 (Funding Token:Project Token), if your upfront capital is 50K USDC, and your starting price is 10 USDC, the amount of tokens you can sell is [(50K / 0.02) / 10] = approx. 250K tokens. In contrast, if your upfront capital is 1M USDC, you‚Äôd be able to sell around 5M worth of tokens.

    To learn more about how LBP and weights work please refer to this primer on the [Balancer Documentation](https://docs.balancer.fi/v/v1/guides/smart-pool-templates-gui/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool).

    Decide on critical parameters, such as LBP duration, starting and ending weights, and estimate the demand (i.e., expected sale rate), is extremely important. Balancer also provides a [LBP simulator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t6VsMJF8lh4xuH_rfPNdT5DM3nY4orF9KFOj2HdMmuY/edit?usp=sharing) that allow you to define these parameters according to your expectations. You can also reach out to your (TODO: Prime Launch account manager?) that will help you out to understand and define the most strategic parameters for your launch. So basically what you are doing here is giving **your project‚Äôs tokens an initial value by collateralizing them and selecting a start weight.**

8. You can further consult the automatically generated chart in which you can find details on important statistics of the Project Token such as the price and fee percentage. **Implied Market Capitalization** displays the implied market valuation if all Project Tokens are part of the circulating supply. **Price Range** displays the lowest and highest price of the Project Token (in USD) during the launch period. Make sure that this chart reflects your expectations.

If supplied, all contributors must accept the disclaimer in order to access the launch. The disclaimer must be formatted as plain text or Markdown.

    Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Guyana, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, United States, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Venezuela, Yemen, the Crimea.

11. Define the Administrator wallet address. 
12. The LBP Administrator has the ability to pause and close the LBP, alter the allowlist and withdraw funding tokens.

# CONTRIBUTE TO A LAUNCH

(TODO)

## Contribute to a Launch

(TODO) To contribute to a launch and receive tokens, follow the steps outlined below.

## <a name="setup-to-contribute"></a>Basic Setup to Contribute

1. Have a compatible wallet set up. Prime Launch connects to most Ethereum wallets, including Metamask and all wallets compatible with WalletConnect. If you don't have an Ethereum wallet yet, set up a [Metamask account](https://metamask.io/) or use a WalletConnect-enabled mobile wallet like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/).

2. Next up, you will need to fund your wallet with some of the tokens you want to contribute to the Launch (funding tokens) and some ETH for paying transaction costs (~$25 worth of ETH is safe). Most wallets will give you instructions on how to acquire those tokens and ETH.

4. On the <a href="/launches">Launches page</a>, you can view the upcoming launches and see which funding tokens the project is accepting in its launch.

## <a name="seed-contribute"></a>Contributing to a Seed Launch

To contribute to a Seed Launch, you must hold some of the launch's funding token.

In the "Contribute" box, exchange the funding token for rights to claim a fixed amount of the project token when the launch ends. Contributors can reclaim the tokens they contributed anytime before the launch ends (but will lose rights to claim project tokens if they do).

Seed Launches end when the maximum funding is reached or the contribution time window is over (whether or not the funding target is reached). If the launch ends and the funding target has not been reached, no project tokens will be distributed and contributors can reclaim their funding tokens.

If the funding target or the maximum funding is reached, contributors can claim project tokens in the "Claim" box after the launch ends. Note, however, that many Seed Launches will have vesting periods with cliffs and/or vesting time:

- **Cliff**: a period of time before any tokens can be claimed
- **Vest**: a period of time following the cliff during which tokens will be unlocked linearly

For example, take a Seed Launch with a 3 day cliff and a 10 day vest. A contributor who has contributed enough to claim 10 tokens will have to wait 3 days for the cliff, after which their 10 tokens will unlock gradually over the next 10 days.

## <a name="lbp-contribute"></a>Contributing to a Liquid Launch (LBP)

To contribute to a Liquid Launch, you must have any token with liquidity on the Balancer Protocol, for example, ETH, DAI, USDC, or D2D.

In the "Contribute" box on the right of the screen, connect with your wallet and accept the Prime Launch Policy. Afterward, select the token and amount you would want to exchange for the project token and click the approve button in the Contribute box to start the transaction to approve these tokens to be spent inside Prime Launch. Once confirmed, you can now click on Contribute, which will begin the transaction to swap your tokens for the project's tokens.

### <a name="how-lbp-works"></a>How a Liquid Launch LBP works
(TODO move or link also to TLDR)

Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) are adjustable Balancer pools used to bootstrap initial liquidity for a token and the initial price discovery of new assets. LBPs are liquidity pools that change weights over time. As the weights change, they create selling pressure on the project token, leading to the price of a project token dropping if there is no buying pressure.

The pool weights initially favor D2D (96%) and will gradually move to an equilibrium where D2D is 50% of the pool. The linear step-down creates constant downward pressure on the price, balancing the upward buy pressure, ideally keeping the price oscillating around perceived market value. This relatively stable price discourages arbitrage bot manipulation as they can't count on the steadily decreasing price.

In practice, this means that contributors should avoid participating too early in Liquid Launches because the valuation will be high, and no price discovery has taken place. The closer to the end of the Liquid Launch, the project token has experienced more price discovery, creating a more stable environment for new contributors.

To understand more about LBs, please check [this detailed Medium article](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/building-liquidity-into-token-distribution-a49d4286e0d4) or visit the Launch support channel in [PrimeDAO Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/x8v59pG).

## Smart Contract Audits

Security is becoming more and more of a challenge, especially in the blockchain space. byterocket's comprehensive Smart Contract Audit Service empowers startups to enterprises to launch and maintain their blockchain applications.

### Avoid Devastating Errors

Prevention is the best antidote. If you choose to audit your code early in the development lifecycle, you get to prevent devastating vulnerabilities and complex issues after launch. ‚Äç byterocket provides you with a comprehensive and complete report immediately after performing our Smart Contract Audit, containing vulnerability details and mitigation guidance.

### Experience Beats Everything

Byterocket been working with Smart Contracts on Ethereum since early 2017, so they've got their fair share of experience. they always strive to stay on top of current developments by being an active part of the Ethereum community. Working closely with various independent security researchers, byterocket constantly explores new ways to ensure your Smart Contract's safety.

## The Audit Process

### Manual Review & Analysis

Multiple auditors go through the smart contract code - line by line - looking for bugs and potential vulnerabilities. They profoundly analyse the implemented logic and its implementation.

### Tools & Testnets

Having concluded a manual analysis, they then leverage state-of-the-art software to analyse and test your code even further, including methods like fuzz-testing. Additionally, they deploy your smart contracts to a testnet to see how it behaves in reality.

### Final Discussion

Having finished the review and analysis independently, our auditors now internally discuss their findings and go through the code once more. The discussion includes possible attack vectors and challenging the protocol in theory and practice.
