<!-- # SEED LAUNCH
 -->
A Seed Launch is a token offering by an early-stage project to a small group of contributors, in order to raise initial resources for the venture.

Seeds use a fixed swap function: contributors can swap the funding token for the seed token at a fixed, pre-determined price. Seeds specify a funding target: if the funding target is not met, contributors can reclaim their tokens.

Project teams may also specify (with an allowlist) which addresses will be allowed to contribute to their Seed. Seed Launches may also include a token vesting schedule for contributors, including both a cliff (lock) and a linear vesting period. This means the project team can specify:

- **Cliff**: an amount of time during which contributors who have received tokens cannot transfer them.
- **Vest**: an amount of time, beginning after the cliff, during which a contributor's purchased tokens unlock linearly.
