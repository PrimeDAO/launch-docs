4. When in doubt while filling out the application form, don't hesitate to reach out to a Prime Launch Representative on Discord or through the [contact form](https://primedao.typeform.com/PrimeLaunchSup).

### Evaluation Process

All launches on Prime Launch are curated by PrimeDAO to ensure that all listed projects are on par with our high standards. After submitting the application form, we will screen your application and shortly let you know if your project is accepted for the next stage of the curation process.

We will then further align on a series of calls to seal our collaboration. At this point your project is accepted for launch and we will then start to set up all additional services to support you during the launch.

If your application is not accepted, consider opening a [Prime Forum](https://forum.prime.xyz/) thread to receive feedback on your application and potentially resubmit your application after incorporating feedback.

### Wizard Walkthrough to Register your Launch

Once your launch is finally approved, you will have to set up the launch parameters with the [Launch Wizard](https://launch.prime.xyz/register).
