<!-- # CONTRIBUTE TO A LAUNCH
 -->
To contribute to a launch and receive project tokens in exchange of funding tokens, follow the steps outlined below.

1. To see upcoming or live launches that you might want to contribute to visit [https://launch.prime.xyz/launches](https://launch.prime.xyz/launches) (for Mainnet) [https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz/launches](https://arbitrum.launch.prime.xyz/launches) (for Arbitrum)
2. Click on ‘Connect to a Wallet’ and accept the [Prime Launch Terms of Service](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service). Make sure you are connected to the intended network.
    - You need to have a compatible wallet set up. Prime Launch connects to most Ethereum wallets, including Metamask and all wallets compatible with WalletConnect. If you don't have an Ethereum wallet yet, set up a [Metamask account](https://metamask.io/) or use a WalletConnect-enabled mobile wallet like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/).

    - The first time you connect to the Prime Launch website with a new wallet you will be required to accept the [Prime Launch Legal Disclaimer](https://launch.prime.xyz/terms-of-service).

3. Next up, you will need to fund your wallet with some of the tokens you want to contribute to the Launch (funding tokens) and some ETH for paying transaction costs (~$25 worth of ETH is safe). Most wallets will give you instructions on how to acquire those tokens and ETH.
4. On the <a href="/launches">Launches page</a>, you can view the upcoming launches and see which funding tokens the project is accepting in its launch.
    - Make sure to DYOR (Do Your Own Research) on the project you want to fund, starting from the links attached to the Launch in the About section of the launch page
    - Make sure you read the project’s disclaimer if there is one
    - Make sure you are eligible to participate as a contributor to the launch.

## Contribute to a Seed Launch

To contribute to a Seed Launch, you must hold some of the launch's funding token.

1. In the "Contribute" box, exchange the funding tokens for rights to claim a fixed amount of the project token when the launch ends. Contributors can claim back the funding tokens they contributed anytime before the launch ends (but will lose rights to claim project tokens if they do).

2. Note that Seed Launches end when the maximum funding is reached or the contribution time window is over (whether or not the funding target is reached). If the launch ends and the funding target has not been reached, no project tokens will be distributed and contributors can reclaim their funding tokens.

If the funding target or the maximum funding is reached, contributors can claim project tokens in the "Claim" box after the launch ends.

    Note, however, that many Seed Launches will have vesting periods with cliffs and/or vesting time:
    
    - Cliff: a period of time before any tokens can be claimed
    - Vest: a period of time following the cliff during which tokens will be unlocked linearly
    
    For example, take a Seed Launch with a 3 day cliff and a 10 day vest. A contributor who has contributed enough to claim 10 tokens will have to wait 3 days for the cliff, after which their 10 tokens will unlock gradually over the next 10 days.
    

## Contributing to a Liquid Launch (TODO)

To contribute to a Liquid Launch, you must have any token with liquidity on the Balancer Protocol, for example, ETH, DAI, USDC, or D2D.

In the "Contribute" box on the right of the screen, connect with your wallet and accept the Prime Launch Policy. Afterward, select the token and amount you would want to exchange for the project token and click the approve button in the Contribute box to start the transaction to approve these tokens to be spent inside Prime Launch. Once confirmed, you can now click on Contribute, which will begin the transaction to swap your tokens for the project's tokens.
